<p><a href="https://letterboxd.com/tobiasandersen2/list/random-movie-roulette/">Random Movie Roulette</a> is a popular Letterboxd list with which a user can use <a href="random.org">RANDOM.org</a> to randomly choose a movie from a list of thousands.</p>

While this is a fun and excting way to choose films and a great concept, scrolling through list pages can be tedious, and unnumbered lists can make this method nigh impossible without manually counting through rows and pages. 

With letterboxd randomiser, randomising letterboxd lists can be done easily. Deciding what to watch will take mere seconds.
